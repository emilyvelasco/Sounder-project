/*

Example for ESP_8_BIT color composite video generator library on ESP32.
Connect GPIO25 to signal line, usually the center of composite video plug.

GFX Hello World

This demonstrates using the ESP_8_BIT_GFX class, which inherits from the
Adafruit GFX base class to deliver an easy to use graphics API. Draws two
rectangles that cycle around the border of the screen. The amount of corners
cut off from these rectangle show the amount of overscan on a particular
screen. In the middle of two rectangles are a bit of text drawn using
Adafruit GFX print() API.
